I did it two times and the second time was to review my code and upload it to GitHub

# Technologies

# Inspiration

It was very exciting for me to create this app, this let me try a little of bit of the taste of what iOS development will look like. I am extremely grateful for all pages that create enough content for us, iOS Developer learners, to thrive and succeed.
